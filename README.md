# SparkML-Streaming-Tweets
Using SparkML to build different machine learning models for simulating a small scale of big data management
<br><br><b>Steps Performed:</b>
<ui>
<li>Using Twitter API to gather tweets
<li>Filtering tweets and preprocessing steps
<li>Using spark to create a dataframe for the dataset
<li>With the help of SparkML, successully build different models in order to define a binary classification (for positive and negative meaning tweets)
</ui>
